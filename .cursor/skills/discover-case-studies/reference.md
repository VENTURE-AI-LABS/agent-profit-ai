# Proof guidelines (AgentProfit.ai)

## Strong proof examples

- **Operator posts revenue proof**: public screenshot of Stripe/MRR dashboard, paired with a public product page and live customer testimonials.
- **On-chain proof**: public wallet address showing strategy/contract revenue, paired with a write-up of the agentic workflow that operates it.
- **Public marketplace earnings**: public storefront metrics (where available), plus order receipts or consistent third-party confirmations.

## Weak proof (use with caution)

- “I made $X” tweets with no supporting links
- Blog posts that cite no primary source
- Anonymous screenshots with no attribution
- Anything that looks like an affiliate funnel or get-rich-quick pitch

## Minimum bar checklist

- [ ] Clear agent description (what tasks are automated, what decisions it makes)
- [ ] Clear profit mechanism (why it earns money)
- [ ] At least 2 proof sources
- [ ] At least 1 proof source is primary, when possible
- [ ] Entry is reproducible at a high-level (steps/architecture, not code)
