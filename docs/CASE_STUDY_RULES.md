## Case study inclusion rules (strict)

AgentProfit.ai only lists **AI agents making money or profit**, backed by **publicly verifiable proof**.

### Required

- **AI agent**: the subject must be an AI agent or agentic workflow (autonomous or semi-autonomous).
- **Money/profit**: there must be a **specific monetary amount** (e.g., `$3,000`, `$5,120 MRR`, `$4M prize`) tied to **money earned/received**.
- **Public proof**:
  - At least **2 proof sources**.
  - At least **1 primary source** whenever possible (official competition page, public payout/prize listing, public dashboard, invoice/receipt, on-chain proof).
  - At least one proof source should include an **excerpt** that contains the **$ amount**.
- **Title must include `$`**: every case study title must contain a dollar amount.
- **Status**:
  - `verified`: money/profit amount is supported by public sources.
  - `speculation`: only allowed if the source is public but weak (e.g., self-reported post without primary evidence) and the description explicitly states the proof gap.

### Not allowed

- **Fundraising as “money made”**: seed/series rounds, valuations, and grants do **not** count as AI agents making money.
- “Credibility-only” milestones without money (leaderboard rank, downloads, users) unless paired with **verified monetary earnings**.

### Examples of acceptable money types

- Competition prizes (cash prizes published by organizer)
- Bug bounty payouts (published payouts, receipts, or platform-visible bounty awards)
- Affiliate commissions (public dashboards/receipts)
- Revenue/MRR/ARR (public dashboards or primary evidence)
- On-chain yield/revenue (public addresses + verifiable transactions)
