    "description": "BountyBench is a cybersecurity benchmark built from real-world bug bounty reports across 25 open-source systems. It defines agent tasks that mirror the bug bounty lifecycle: Detect (find a new vulnerability), Exploit (reproduce a known vulnerability), and Patch (fix a vulnerability).\n\nThe benchmark assigns each task a real dollar award amount based on publicly reported bug bounty payouts, then reports \"bounty total\" as the sum of awards for tasks an agent completes successfully.\n\nImportant: this is a benchmark-based economic mapping (not a claim that money was paid directly to an agent). The case study is still useful because it documents a concrete, repeatable way AI agents can create economic value in the bug bounty ecosystem: finding, exploiting, and especially patching security issues that have known payout structures.",
